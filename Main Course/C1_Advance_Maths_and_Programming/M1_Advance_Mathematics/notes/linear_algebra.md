# Linear Algebra

## 1. Vectors Recall
- Ordered list of numbers.
- Represent magnitude and direction.

---

## 2. Matrices Recall
- 2D array of numbers.
- Used for transformations.

---

## 3. Linear Transformations
- Function preserving vector addition and scaling.

### Property
T(a + b) = T(a) + T(b)

---

## 4. Change of Basis
- Representing vectors in different coordinate systems.

### Formula
v_new = B⁻¹ v_old

---

## 5. Transformation in Different Basis
- Matrix representation changes with basis.

---

## 6. Inverse of Matrix
A⁻¹ A = I

---

## 7. Rank
- Number of linearly independent columns.

---

## 8. Column Space
- Span of columns of matrix A.

---

## 9. Null Space
- Set of vectors x such that Ax = 0.

---

## 10. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Vector direction unchanged after transformation.

### Formula
A v = λ v

---

## 11. Eigendecomposition
- Decomposes matrix into eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

### Formula
A = Q Λ Q⁻¹
