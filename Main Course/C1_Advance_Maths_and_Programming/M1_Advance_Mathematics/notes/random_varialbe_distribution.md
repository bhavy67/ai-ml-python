# Random Variables & Distributions

## 1. Random Variables
- A variable whose value depends on random outcome.
- Discrete or Continuous.

---

## 2. Expected Value
- Average value of a random variable.

### Discrete
E[X] = Σ x · P(X = x)

### Continuous
E[X] = ∫ x f(x) dx

---

## 3. Binomial Distribution
- Models number of successes in n trials.

### Formula
P(X = k) = C(n, k) p^k (1 − p)^(n − k)

---

## 4. Continuous Probability Distribution
- Uses probability density function (PDF).

---

## 5. Probability Density Function (PDF)
- Area under curve gives probability.

### Properties
- f(x) ≥ 0
- ∫ f(x) dx = 1

---

## 6. Normal Distribution
- Bell-shaped distribution.
- Defined by mean μ and variance σ².

### Formula
f(x) = (1 / √(2πσ²)) e^(-(x−μ)² / 2σ²)

---

## 7. Standard Normal Distribution
- Mean = 0, Variance = 1

### Transformation
Z = (X − μ) / σ
