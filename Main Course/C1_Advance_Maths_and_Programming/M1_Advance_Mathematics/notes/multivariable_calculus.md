# Multivariable Calculus

## 1. Functions – Primer
- Maps inputs to outputs.
- ML models are functions.

---

## 2. Partial Derivatives
- Rate of change w.r.t one variable.

### Formula
∂f/∂x , ∂f/∂y

---

## 3. Gradient
- Vector of partial derivatives.
- Direction of steepest ascent.

### Formula
∇f = [∂f/∂x₁, ∂f/∂x₂, ..., ∂f/∂xₙ]

---

## 4. Vector-Valued Functions
- Output is a vector.

### Example
f(t) = [x(t), y(t)]

---

## 5. Jacobian Matrix
- Matrix of partial derivatives.

### Formula
J = ∂(f₁, f₂, …) / ∂(x₁, x₂, …)

---

## 6. Hessian Matrix
- Second-order partial derivatives.

### Formula
Hᵢⱼ = ∂²f / ∂xᵢ ∂xⱼ
