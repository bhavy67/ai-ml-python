# Probability

## 1. Probability Recall
- Probability measures likelihood of an event.
- Values range between 0 and 1.

### Formula
P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total outcomes

---

## 2. Conditional Probability
- Probability of A given B has occurred.

### Formula
P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

---

## 3. Bayes’ Theorem
- Reverses conditional probability.
- Used heavily in ML (Naive Bayes).

### Formula
P(A | B) = [P(B | A) P(A)] / P(B)

---

## 4. Probability Without Experiment
- Used when outcomes are theoretical.
- Based on symmetry or known distributions.

---

## 5. Cumulative Probability
- Probability that a random variable is ≤ a value.

### Formula
P(X ≤ x) = Σ P(X = xi)
